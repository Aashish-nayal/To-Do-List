## Important Notes ⚠️

- This app is for demonstration purposes and may not include data persistence across sessions.
- For security reasons, closing the main browser window programmatically is not allowed.
- Please ensure to fill both the task description and due date fields before adding a new task.
- Tasks are sorted based on due dates in ascending order.
- For the app to work properly, you need to host it on a localhost or a server. Simply opening the index file as a web page won't provide the required functionality.
